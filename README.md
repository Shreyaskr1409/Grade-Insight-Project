# AIML-Project

This Repository holds documentation for a College project made by a group of Students from National Institute of Technology, Rourkela.
Project aims to help students in determining what they need to work on in order to get good grades and perform well in their exams without stressing over doing everything all at once as much as they can (this can harm their mental state).
